/**
 * Black sand is sand that is black in color. This sand is a heavy, partly
 * magnetic mixture of usually fine sands, found as part of a placer deposit
 * (a placer deposit is an accumulation of valuable minerals formed by gravity
 * separation during sedimentary processes). This type of black sand is found
 * on beaches near a volcano and consists of tiny fragments of lava.
