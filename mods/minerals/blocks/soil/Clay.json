/**
 * Clay Soil which is composed of very fine particles, usually silicates of
 * aluminum and/or iron and magnesium. Clay soil impedes the flow of water,
 * meaning it absorbs water slowly and then retains it for a long time. Wet
 * clay soil is heavy and sticky, and tends to swell from the added moisture.
 * When dry, clay soil shrinks and settles. The top layer can bake into a hard,
 * concrete-like crust which cracks. Some plants have difficulty growing in clay
 * soil because their seedlings or roots are unable to penetrate through hard,
 * dry soil, or can be waterlogged in wet soil.
