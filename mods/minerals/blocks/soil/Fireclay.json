/**
 * Fire clay is resistant to high temperatures, having fusion points higher than 1,600Â°C, therefore it is suitable for
 * lining furnaces, as fire brick, and manufacture of utensils used in the metalworking industries, such as crucibles,
 * saggars, retorts and glassware. Because of its stability during firing in the kiln, it can be used to make complex
 * items of pottery such as pipes and sanitary ware.
