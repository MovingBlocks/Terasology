/**
 * A diatom is an organism. When diatoms die, their silica shells accumulate on the floor of the body of water in
 * which they lived. Thick layers of these diatom shells have been fossilized (that is, preserved) in the rock record.
 * Such layers, or beds, of diatoms are called diatomaceous earth, or diatomite. It is very porous which makes it
 * useful in a number of filtering applications.
 *
 * Because of its porosity, diatomite has been used extensively as a filter for a variety of purposes. It is used to
 * filter impurities out of everything from beer and wine to oils and greases. Similarly, diatomite is used to filter
 * impurities from water to produce drinkable (potable) water in public water systems. In this situation, the diatomite
 * removes bacteria and protozoa.
