/**
 * Jet is a geological material and is considered to be a minor gemstone. Jet is not considered a true mineral,
 * but rather a mineraloid as it has an organic origin, being derived from decaying wood under extreme pressure.
 * Jet is very easy to carve but it is difficult to create detail without breaking so it takes some time for learning
 * and executing more elaborate carving.
