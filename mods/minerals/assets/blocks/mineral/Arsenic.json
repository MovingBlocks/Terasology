/**
 * Arsenic has been used as a poison. Arsenic ore is used in the manufacturing of glass. Sometimes Nickel, silver, iron,
 * and sulfur are also commonly found on arsenic specimens.
 *
 * Environments contaminated with arsenic contain only a few species and fewer numbers within species. If levels of
 * arsenic are high enough, only resistant organisms, such as certain microbes, may be present.
 *
 *  If a large amount of arsenic is swallowed by humans, in a form that is readily absorbed, it can cause rapid
 *  poisoning and death. The gut, the heart and the nervous system are affected. Those who survive acute poisoning may
 *  develop pigment spots in the skin and damage to red blood cells, bone marrow, liver, nerves and brain. Long-term
 *  exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking water can cause thickening and pigment spots in the skin, and cancer
 *  of the skin, lungs, bladder or kidney.
 *
 *  Gives off a garlic odor, especially when struck or heated.
