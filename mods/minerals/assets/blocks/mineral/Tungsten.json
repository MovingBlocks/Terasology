/**
 * In tungsten's raw form, it is a hard metal that is often brittle
 * and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds
 * that of many steels), and becomes malleable enough that it can be worked easily.
 * It is worked by forging, drawing, extruding or sintering.
