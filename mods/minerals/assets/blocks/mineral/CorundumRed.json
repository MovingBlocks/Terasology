/**
 * Corundum is a extremely hard mineral occurring in many colors, either as shapeless grains or as rhombohedral
 * crystals. It also occurs in gem varieties such as ruby and sapphire and in a dark-colored variety that is used for
 * polishing and scraping. Corundum is found in igneous and carbonate rocks. This is the red verity.
