/**
 * Graphite is a mineral found in certain metamorphic layers of rock. Graphite may be considered the highest grade of
 * coal. Graphite is also commonly used in the form of powders. Graphite my be flammable on contact with magma but
 * will never melt, meaning torches mixed with graphite would be an excellent long-burning flame.
