/**
 * Gneiss makes up the largest part of the Earth's lower crust. Pretty much everywhere on the continents, you will
 * drill straight down and eventually strike gneiss.Gneiss is a typical rock type formed by regional metamorphism,
 * in which a sedimentary or igneous rock has been deeply buried and subjected to high temperatures and pressures.
 * Metamorphic Gneiss has many uses as a building material such as flooring, ornamental stones, gravestones, facing
 * stones on buildings and work surfaces.
