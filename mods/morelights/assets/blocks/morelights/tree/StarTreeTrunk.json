/**
 * This is a tree. Treat it well and it will grow tall and strong.
 * Idea is that all trees (as defined in the block/plant/tree package anyway  will have leaves
 * L-system generation stat sets could also go here (or in their own separate thing?)
 * Entirely separate trees would have their own tree + leaf block definitions (rename the plain "Tree" then)
