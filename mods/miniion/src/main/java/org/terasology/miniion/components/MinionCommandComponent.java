 * clicking a 3d and /or 4th point will limit the height/ set depth of the selection, depending if the block clicked was higher / lower then the startpoint
 * if only a depth point was selected, the selection will only be downwards
 * only rectangular selection with no feedback to user
 * selected blocks will get grouped by height, and minions will gather top to bottom
 * startpoint should be a miniion (waypoint) flag block
