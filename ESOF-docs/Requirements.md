###Levantamento de Requisitos

New requirements are suggested by everyone who wants to, through the [suggestions forum](http://forum.terasology.org/forum/suggestions.21/). From there, the original author of the suggestion (or someone else, provided they are interested in the suggestion), specifying what needs to be done in order to accomplish that requirement. After that, the topic is moved to the [modules forum](http://forum.terasology.org/forum/modules.55/), integrating it in a new module (or in one of the already existing modules). These modules are in independent repositories. When the code is implemented, tested, and working, it is merged into the repository of the module (without resorting to a pull request). After that, the module code is tested (with Jenkins) by one of the main developers and added to the next release.
