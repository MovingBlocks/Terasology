## Degree of Testability

In the following topics Terasology's degree of testability will be discussing, focusing mainly on verification (which consists in ensuring that the product is being well built with the requirements obtained in mind) and validation (which consists in ensuring that the product will meet the intended purpose and the needs of its stakeholers).

###Controllability

Terasology implements unit testing to test both the engine and module components.

While controlling the component under test, when said component is a module, is rather easy, since most modules are not dependant of anything else in order to run, and even those that do depend, usually have no more that one or two dependencies, making their controllability not much of a problem. However, in what concerns the engine component, the controllability is significantly lower, since it depends on several modules in order to successfully run - and consequently, be tested.

###Observability

As said in previous reports, Terasology uses [Jenkins](http://jenkins.terasology.org/) in order to automatically build and test every time a pull request is issued. If we check the [statistics](http://jenkins.terasology.org/view/Statistics/) page, we can see the test results of the various modules, namely which modules had failed tests, information regarding recent build history test results, and information regarding tests that are not directly related to JUnit tests, but also involve detecting eventual functional and structural defects in the modules. It also displays information regarding compiler warnings and line coverage on the JUnit tests.

The tests that are not direclty related to JUnit tests include a "checkstyle" test, which evaluates the style/conventions used in the various modules, to ensure that the entire code is using the same style, a "findbugs" test, which scans for some common code drawbacks that may lead to bugs, PMD testing (which checks for common programming flaws, such as unused variables, unnecessary object creation, empty catch blocks when handling exceptions, among other things) and open task checking (which simply looks for TODO keywords in the code indicating what needs to be done).

In what regards the game's engine, the test results can be seen in [this](http://jenkins.terasology.org/job/Terasology/) page, more specifically in the graphs to the right. These graphs depict the trend for the latest builds in what concerns the tests described above in this subsection. If we click in a build number in the graph, we will get more detailed information for that test, in that build.

From this, we can easily assume that it is very easy to observe test results, since this information is conveniently displayed in a table and, if we wish to know more about something (for instance, about the warnings generated by a test), all we have to do is click on the link in the corresponding cell and we will be provided with more specific information regarding that specific test.

###Isolateability

Terasology doesn't implement unit tests in all modules, mostly because some modules really have not much of a reason to be tested (for instance, art-related modules) and because tests must be implemented by the module creators, and some don't implement them. This makes testing module components in isolation much more difficult.

Regarding the engine, the tests are implemented in a separate folder (called engine-tests). Although tests are usually kept in the same module, the fact that Terasology has some utility test classes that can be used by the modules, they decided to split them out in order to get the dependency resolution right (more specifically, module unit tests depend on engine tests which depends on the engine).


- Isolateability: The degree to which the component under test (CUT) can be tested in isolation.
All components are tested on their own. 

###Separation of concerns
- Separation of concerns: The degree to which the component under test has a single, well defined responsibility.
Terasology is pretty organized in this aspect. It is separated into several different folders and files, each one has with its own responsibility.

###Understandability
- Understandability: The degree to which the component under test is documented or self-explaining.
When it comes to the code itself, it’s easily readable because it can be self-explanatory and often commentaries can be found.

###Heterogenety
- Heterogeneity: The degree to which the use of diverse technologies requires to use diverse test methods and tools in parallel.
