##Controlability
Terasology’s is pretty poor in what comes to testing. The amount of test in his modules is practically inexistent. Only 25.86% of Terasology lines have been correctly tested.

##Observability
The tests don’t tell much about the project. The tests implemented are unit tests, and units tests don’t tell much about the behavior, they just tell us is the code is functional or not. 

##Isolateability
All components are tested on their own. 

##Separation of concerns
Terasology is pretty organized in this aspect. It is separated into several different folders and files, each one has with its own responsibility.

##Understandability
When it comes to the code itself, it’s easily readable because it can be self-explanatory and often commentaries can be found.

##Heterogenety
