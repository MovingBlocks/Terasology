# Modules

Content, gameplay mechanics, and mostly everything other than the engine that allows the game to run is stored in what we call "modules" which are _similar_ to the traditional meaning of "mods" but intended to be smaller building blocks you'd normally put several of together to make one traditional "mod".

Modules in turn are sometimes grouped in "Gameplay Templates" which are like Minecraft-style mod packs. These are directly available via drop-down at world creation and are the suggested way to enable more content. Do **not** enable every single module manually! :-) 

You can customize module selection with the "Modules" button but you generally should enable very few or rely on the gameplay templates. Some world generator types may be registered by a module and auto-select that and maybe other modules if you choose that world type. Modules may also enable additional console commands (listed by the "help" command when active).

The game can download module updates from our central meta-server and clients connecting to a game server will be automatically sent the right version of any enabled modules! 

Be cautious in downloading modules beyond the ones shipped with the ["Omega Zip"](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases) - other modules not bundled with the game are likely still in development or unstable and may crash the game.

Module source repositories live under the [Terasology organization](https://github.com/Terasology) on GitHub, while the engine level projects live under the [MovingBlocks organization](https://github.com/MovingBlocks).

Here's a list of modules bundled with the game by default (this line-up will change now and then). It should roughly match this category in Jenkins: http://jenkins.terasology.org/view/Modules and you can download updated modules from there if needed.
