## Case Study 1: Handling Missing Classes in Third-Party Libraries

### Issue:
A class from a third-party library failed to load, even though it was directly referenced in the engine code.

### Solution:
1. **Identify the Class**: Determine the specific class or package causing issues.
2. **Update Permission Lists**: Add the class/package to the `ExternalApiWhitelist` to ensure it is accessible.
3. **Adjust Security Settings**: Modify the security policy to grant necessary permissions.

### Code Example:
```java
// ModuleManager.java
permissionSet.grantPermission(new PropertyPermission("reactor.bufferSize.x", "read"));
