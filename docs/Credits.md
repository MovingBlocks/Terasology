Additional Notes
--------

A few of Terasology's base textures use the awesome [Good Morning Craft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1227051-16x-good-morning-craft) texture pack by Louis Durrant. Make sure to visit his <a href="http://www.carrotcakestudios.co.uk/">homepage</a> and support his work.
