# Migrating to Project Reactor

## Motivation

The two main reasons we are adopting Reactor for our concurrent operations:

1. Using a consistent API helps with thread management, making it easier to allocate the right amount of threads and clean them up when we need to.
2. The Flux API offered by Project Reactor provides better ways to define and schedule asynchronous operations than the standard Java API does.

## Deprecations

- The creation of threads and threadpools is something that should be mediated by the engine.
Modules should not be using `new Thread()` directly.
- [o.t.e.utilites.concurrency.TaskMaster](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/blob/v5.2.0/engine/src/main/java/org/terasology/engine/utilities/concurrency/TaskMaster.java) and its related `Task` class.

## New Interfaces

Most [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io) classes (from Reactor Core, Reactor Extra, and Reactor Test) are available to modules.
The [Reactor Reference Guide](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/) includes an introduction to them.
(It _occasionally_ assumes familiarity with the Reactive Streams specification, but its examples are complete on their own.)

The [o.t.e.core.GameScheduler](https://jenkins.terasology.io/teraorg/job/Terasology/job/engine/job/develop/javadoc/org/terasology/engine/core/GameScheduler.html) class provides methods for scheduling work
or obtaining a [Scheduler](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#schedulers) instance.

## Migration Guide

### TaskMaster

Replacements for TaskMaster methods:

* `TaskMaster.create*(name, threads)`: Use `GameScheduler` to use an existing `Scheduler` instance.
We do not expect modules need to create new Schedulers.
* `Task`: [Runnable](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runnable.html). (Runnable is a Functional Interface in Java; any zero-argument method may be passed anywhere a Runnable is expected.)
* `task.getName()`: Pass a name to `GameScheduler.scheduleParallel(name, task)`.
* `tm.offer(task)`: `GameScheduler.scheduleParallel(name, task)`.
* `tm.put(task)`: This is a blocking method; no direct replacement is offered.
Replace it with an asynchronous method, perhaps using Reactor's [Mono](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#mono) to schedule work to continue after its completion.

The above methods are only the ones that most directly correspond to the old TaskMaster interface.
You will likely want to take advantage of other [Flux operations](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#which-operator) to use the results of asynchronous methods and handle errors.
