## Understanding Terasology

Terasology itself is a pure sandbox. Gameplay is implemented through modules, which can add anything from new blocks and crafting methods to entirely new game modes.

- 🏛️ **[Architecture Overview](Codebase-Structure.md)**
  - Understand the high-level structure of the project.
- 🔧 **[Entity System Architecture](Entity-System-Architecture.md)**
  - Dive into how our entity system powers the game.
- 🎲 **[Events and Systems](Events-and-Systems.md)**
  - Explore how to inject new logic and life into the game.
- 🏗️ **[Block Architecture](https://github.com/Terasology/TutorialAssetSystem/wiki/Block-Attributes)**
  - Delve into the building blocks of the game world.

## Core and Libraries
  - This core is backed by several in-house libraries, such as [MovingBlocks/gestalt](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/gestalt), providing the entity system and module management, or our own UI library [MovingBlocks/TeraNUI](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TeraNUI).
  - The actual game content is added by modules on top of that.
