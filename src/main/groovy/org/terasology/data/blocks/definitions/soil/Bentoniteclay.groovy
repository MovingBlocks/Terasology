/**
 * When taken orally, liquid bentonite cleans the internal systems by detoxifying the toxic agents
 * (free radicals, herbicides, intestinal parasites, pesticides and even pathogenic viruses). For effective colon
 * cleansing regimen, bentonite clay is an ideal medicine. The most suitable time for drinking this liquid is one hour
 * before meals or immediately after meals. For improving the taste, it can be taken with juice or applesauce.
 *
 * Being inert or chemically inactive, liquid bentonite does not get digested or absorbed by the gastrointestinal
 * tract, and so remains unchanged. So, when it passes through the intestinal tract, it binds the positively charged
 * toxins and absorbs them. The bentonite clay takes the form of a sponge-like structure when it expands on absorbing
 * water. So, all the toxins are attracted towards this sponge magnetically, and eventually the bentonite is drained
 * out from the body, along with the toxins bound to its multiple surfaces. This hydrated clay fixes free oxygen in the
 * blood stream and increases the T-cell count (T-cells are a type of lymphocytes that are an important part of the
 * body's defense mechanisms).
 *
 * Other than removing bacterial, organic and non-organic toxicity, the liquid clay also benefits the body by managing
 * heartburn, hay fever, allergy and anemia. Regular use of liquid bentonite clay, has shown significant results in
 * curing several disorders like diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, ulcers, etc. Clearer complexion, brighter and
 * whiter eyes, improved presence of mind and reduction in emotional stress, repair of tissues' wear and tear and
 * improved bowel movements, are some of the amazing healing capabilities of this clay. It raises the body's
 * elimination level and supports organ functions, thereby strengthening the immune system.
 *
 * Bentonite clay can also be used externally on skin for curing acne and skin rashes. It also helps in soothing muscle
 * damage, carpal tunnel, bruises, cuts and wounds. Other skin ailments like eczema, psoriasis, bacterial and fungal
 * infections can also be addressed, by applying a bentonite clay pack to the affected area of the skin.
