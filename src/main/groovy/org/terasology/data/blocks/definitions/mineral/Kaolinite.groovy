/**
 *  Kaolinite is a clay mineral. Kaolin is used in ceramics, medicine, coated paper, as a food additive in toothpaste,
 *  as a light diffusing material in white incandescent light bulbs, and in cosmetics. Kaolinite has also seen some use
 *  in organic farming, as a spray applied to crops to deter insect damage, and in the case of apples, to prevent sun
 *  scald. Kaolin is extensively used as a paint or white wash in traditional stone masonry homes in Nepal.
