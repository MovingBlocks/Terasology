 * Mica is widely distributed and occurs in igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock layers. Mica in powder form could
 * be uses as a mild abrasive to aid polishing surfaces. Mica is also used as an insulator in concrete block, home
 * attics, and can be poured into walls.  Mica may also be used as a soil conditioner, especially in potting soil mixes
 * and in gardening plots. Greases used for axles are composed of a compound of fatty oils to which mica, tar or
 * graphite is added to increase the durability of the grease and give it a better surface.
