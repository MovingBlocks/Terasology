Welcome!

The Terasology project was born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo and is becoming a stable platform for various types of gameplay settings in a voxel world.

The [creators and maintainers](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/blob/develop/docs/Credits.md) are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians. We encourage others to join!

Terasology is fully open source and licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) and available in source code form at [GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology) 

We encourage contributions from anybody and try to keep a warm and friendly community. See [our published code of conduct](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/blob/develop/docs/Conduct.md) adopted from the [template by the TODOGroup](https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct).

## Playing

Terasology requires Java 8 - [download it here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). Also make sure that your graphics card driver is up to date.

For easy setup (recommended) you can use our launcher - [download it here](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/releases)

Direct download stable builds are uploaded to [our release section here on GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases) while the cutting-edge develop version can be downloaded direct [here from our Jenkins](http://jenkins.terasology.org/job/DistroOmega/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/distros/omega/build/distributions/TerasologyOmega.zip)

For more information about playing like hot keys or server hosting see the [dedicated page](docs/Playing.md) or check out the [modules](docs/Modules.md)


## Developing

We have gone to great lengths to make developing and modding Terasology as easy as possible. We use Gradle to automate just about everything. As long as you have a [Java 8 SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) running from source is a two step process:

* Clone the code or download a zip
* Run `gradlew game` in the root of the project directory 

That's really it! If you want the project set up in IntelliJ (our favored IDE) you run `gradlew idea` then load the generated project config. Then you get a bunch of run configurations and other stuff for free!

For more on developing/modding see the [wiki](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki)
