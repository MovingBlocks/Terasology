Terasology
==========

![Terasology](/engine/src/main/resources/assets/textures/menuBackground.jpg "Terasology")

Terasology is a game that pays ample tribute to [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net) in initial look and origin, but stakes out its own niche by aiming for the NPC-helper and caretaker focus from such games as [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves) and [Dungeon Keeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper), while striving for added depth and sophistication.

Terasology is an open source project started by Benjamin "begla" Glatzel to research procedural terrain generation and efficient rendering techniques in Java using the [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org). The engine uses a block-based voxel-like approach as seen in Minecraft.

The creators of Terasology are a diverse mix of software developers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians.

Setup
--------

Terasology requires Java 7, the newer the better - [download it here](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp). Also make sure that your graphics card driver is up to date.

For easy setup you can use our launcher - [download it here](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/releases)

For direct downloads you can get the latest [stable version here](http://jenkins.movingblocks.net/job/TerasologyStable/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/distributions/Terasology.zip) or our cutting-edge develop version [here from our Jenkins](http://jenkins.movingblocks.net/job/Terasology/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/distributions/Terasology.zip)

You can use the Windows executable or one of the default launch scripts to start the game. They will setup your Java Virtual Machine to allocate up to 1024 MB of memory. Under Linux and Mac OS X the run script needs the access permission "Execute" to run properly: "chmod +x [scriptname].sh".

Console Commands
--------

Press Tab to show the in-game console. Block names and some other things are not capital sensitive while command names are. Copy paste is supported and up/down arrow will cycle through commands you've used before. Hitting Tab again with a partially typed command will auto-complete it (including abbreviated camel case like rS for restoreSpeed)

* help - Show in-game help (more thorough)
* ghost - fly / no-clip mode (old double-jump for "god" mode)
* hspeed - radically increase your horizontal move speed
* hjump - jump really high. Almost like flying - but it isn't. Just jump good.
* restoreSpeed - normalizes speed (both horizontal and vertical)
* help "giveBlock" - Shows detailed help on the "giveBlock" command
* giveBlock "Water" - Gives 16 water blocks
* giveBlock "Stone" "Slope" - Gives you 16 clay blocks in the "slope" shape
* giveBlock "Marble" "Stair" 99 - Gives you 99 marble stair blocks
* giveBlock "Chest" - Gives you a Chest block you can place, activate ('E'), put stuff in, break, pick up, place elsewhere, find same stuff in it!
* giveBlock "TNT" - Gives you 16 TNT blocks you can place and activate ('E') to blow up
* listBlocks - Lists all actively used blocks (have been loaded for the world)
* listFreeShapeBlocks - Lists all blocks that can be requested in any known shape
* listShapes - Lists the available shapes
* ~~teleport 42 42 42 - Warps the player to x = 42, y = 42, z = 42~~
* ~~fullHealth - Fully restores the player's health~~

Building and running from source
--------

Run any commands in the project root directory

*  Download / clone the source from GitHub
*  To prepare for IntelliJ run: `gradlew idea`
*  To prepare for Eclipse run: `gradlew eclipse`
*  To run from the command line: `gradlew run`
*  For more tasks: `gradlew tasks`

You may also need to tweak IDE settings further for your convenience, in particular for Eclipse. See [Dev Setup](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Dev-Setup) in our wiki for more details.

Note that by default stored data (config, saves, etc) is sent to a user profile directory like Saved Games under Windows. Add `-homedir` to a run configuration or command line execution to use the project dir instead (this is done automatically in some cases including IntelliJ and `gradlew run`)

If you want to pull down the source code for a module you can easily do so via Gradle:

* `gradlew fetchModuleSample`
* `gradlew idea`

This fetches the module source for the "Sample" module and the second command fetches any dependencies and updates the IntelliJ project structure so you can see it as a module. Likewise for Eclipse or any other setup you should run any one `gradlew` command to make sure the new module's dependencies have been fetched as well. See [Codebase Structure](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Codebase-Structure) in the wiki for more.

Modules
--------

Content, gameplay mechanics, and mostly everything other than the engine that allows the game to run is stored in what we call "modules" which are _similar_ to the traditional meaning of "mods" but intended to be smaller building blocks you'd normally put several of together to make one true "mod".

Modules must be enabled during world creation by selecting them using the "Modules" button. Some world generator types may be registered by a module and auto-select that and maybe other modules if you choose that world type. Modules may also enable additional console commands (listed by the "help" command when active).

Here's a list of modules bundled with the game by default (as of this writing anyway - this line-up will change now and then). It should roughly match this category in Jenkins: http://jenkins.movingblocks.net/view/Modules and you can download updated modules from there if needed.

* [BlockNetwork](https://github.com/Terasology/BlockNetwork) - a framework to support blocks that can communicate with each other in some fashion
* [Cities](https://github.com/Terasology/Cities) - procedural city placer and plot organizer, also places roads to connect cities
* Core - mandatory content needed for normal game launch
* [Crops](https://github.com/Terasology/Crops) - a series of crop-like plants with multiple growth stages
* [Fences](https://github.com/Terasology/Fences) - fences!
* [FunnyBlocks](https://github.com/Terasology/FunnyBlocks) - cheese wheels and bowling pins - why not
* [Hunger](https://github.com/Terasology/Hunger) - makes the player slowly gets hungry (needs actual GUI work and ways to then actually eat food though). Console `hungerCheck` for stats
* [LightAndShadowResources](https://github.com/Terasology/LightAndShadowResources) - IMMA FIRINâ€™ MAH LASR!! Art assets for the Light & Shadow concept
* [Malicious](https://github.com/Terasology/Malicious) - a series of module security tests to check that modules cannot do naughty things when running
* [Maze](https://github.com/Terasology/Maze) - a maze generator. Right-click with the provided maze tool on one block then again on another and a maze will generate between the two points (in multiple layers if the area is tall enough)
* [Minerals](https://github.com/Terasology/Minerals) - a large collection of mineral blocks
* [MoreLights](https://github.com/Terasology/MoreLights) - assorted illuminated blocks
* [NameGenerator](https://github.com/Terasology/NameGenerator) - can create random themed names for use by other modules, or via console using commands like `generateNameList 10`
* [Oreons](https://github.com/Terasology/Oreons) - little sentient cookie people! Don't do much yet. Place with `spawnPrefab "Oreons:OreonGuard"` in the console
* [Portals](https://github.com/Terasology/Portals) - allows placement of portal blocks that'll spawn creatures from the LASR model - get a portal from the console with `giveBlock "portal"`
* [Sample](https://github.com/Terasology/Sample) - miscellaneous example content showcasing module usage
* [Signalling](https://github.com/Terasology/Signalling) - circuitry implementation based on BlockNetwork, similar to redstone
* [Soils](https://github.com/Terasology/Soils) - a small pack of different soil types
