Welcome!

The [creators and maintainers](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/blob/develop/docs/Credits.md) are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians. We encourage others to join!

Internet connectivity is required for downloading Terasology via the Launcher, afterwards playing offline is possible.

For easy game setup (recommended) you can use our launcher - [download it here.](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/releases)

For more information about playing, like hot keys or server hosting, see the [dedicated page](docs/Playing.md) or check out the [modules.](docs/Modules.md)


#### Alternative Installation Methods

If you already have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, you may use a direct download release as an alternative to using the [launcher](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/releases). Java versions 8 and 11 are supported.

Direct download stable builds are uploaded to [our release section here on GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases) while the cutting-edge develop version can be downloaded direct [here from our Jenkins](http://jenkins.terasology.org/job/DistroOmega/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/distros/omega/build/distributions/TerasologyOmega.zip)


## Developing

We strive to make developing and modding Terasology as easy as possible.  See our wiki for instructions on [setting up a development environment](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Dev-Setup) and how to [develop modules](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Developing-Modules).
