Terasology
==========

![Terasology](/engine/src/main/resources/assets/textures/menuBackground.jpg "Terasology")

Terasology is a game that pays ample tribute to [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net) in initial look and origin, but stakes out its own niche by aiming for the NPC-helper and caretaker focus from such games as [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves) and [Dungeon Keeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper), while striving for added depth and sophistication.

Terasology is an open source project started by Benjamin "begla" Glatzel to research procedural terrain generation and efficient rendering techniques in Java using the [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org). The engine uses a block-based voxel-like approach as seen in Minecraft. You can check out his blog at [Moving Blocks!](http://blog.movingblocks.net)

The creators of Terasology are a diverse mix of software developers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians.

Setup
--------

Terasology requires Java 8, the newer the better - [download it here](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp). Also make sure that your graphics card driver is up to date.

For easy setup (recommended) you can use our launcher - [download it here](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/releases) which offers different release lines - for instance stable, develop, and legacy

Direct download stable builds are uploaded to [our release section here on GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases) while the cutting-edge develop version can be downloaded direct [here from our Jenkins](http://jenkins.terasology.org/job/DistroOmega/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/distros/omega/build/distributions/TerasologyOmega.zip)

You can use the Windows executable or one of the default launch scripts to start the game. They will setup your Java Virtual Machine to allocate up to 1024 MB of memory. Under Linux and Mac OS X the run script needs the access permission "Execute" to run properly: "chmod +x [scriptname].sh".

The game auto-saves at regular intervals so it is decently crash-hardened at this point (no more playing for 20 minutes then poof lost world via crash). Still no guarantees though! Pre-Alpha :-)

Multiplayer
--------

To name yourself for a multiplayer game use Settings / Player. You can also pick a color, which will affect your placeholder monkey head player avatar, name in chat, and floating name tag.

You can host a local server using the game client and have friends connect to your IP. Game port is 25777 which needs to be open and forwarded to your PC.

Unlike in single player in a multiplayer setting permissions are enforced for console commands. Several permission types are available, if a command is not allowed it will state which permission is missing.

You can also run a headless server, but this is harder to configure at the moment. You need to launch the game via command line, for example with a downloaded version:

*Note: This changed to include the `/libs` after stable 49. The name of the .exe also may differ*

`java -jar libs/Terasology.jar -headless -homedir=server`

This will launch the server and store game files in the "server" subdir at the place you launch from (otherwise it'll use the default path, which could clash with a client on the same system). You can add `-serverPort=#####` to run on a different port than default 25777.

In this case *there is no default player with rights beyond "chat"*. You need to gain admin powers yourself using the `oneTimeAuthorizationKey` that generates in the server's `config.cfg`. This gives you all permission types except "debug"

Join the server and run the console command `usePermissionKey <key>` where you replace `<key>` with the value from the server's config file. This only works once.

After you have rights to manage *user* permissions you can grant other players specific permissions by executing `givePermission <player> <permission>` in the console, replacing `<player>` with the desired player's name (case sensitive).

With *server* rights you can terminate the server gracefully via `shutdownServer` in the console. Otherwise you can kill a headless server with `CTRL-C` in a terminal / command prompt. Running headless with the .exe on Windows is not recommended as it "detaches" from its command prompt so you get no handy logging there or any way to issue a break to the process. If you cannot connect or get "op" you may have to terminate the process manually via Task Manager or comparable.

Finally to get modules configured for a headless server you either have to manually edit in a list of modules to the `defaultModSelection` section, and `defaultGenerator` for your chosen world, then delete the `saves` dir for the server and restart it. Start a single player world and look at the `config.cfg` that generates for hints.

If you include the "CheatsForAll" module in config for a server then you can bypass a lot of the admin setup as every player will be able to use `cheat` commands, like `giveBlock` - however, keep in mind then everybody can cheat, this is really more for testing :-)

Alternatively you can run from source and supply parameters for game configuration. For instance here is how you would launch with ThroughoutTheAges active, our most complete setting. Keep in mind the module list may change any day, check in the game client what modules highlight with TTA selected to confirm.

`gradlew -PworldGen="WoodAndStone:throughoutTheAges" -PextraModules="AlterationEffects,AnotherWorld,AnotherWorldPlants,ClimateConditions,CopperAndBronze,Core,Crops,Fences,Fluid,Genome,GrowingFlora,Hunger,Journal,MarkovChains,MultiBlock,PlantPack,NameGenerator,Seasons,StructuralResources,ThroughoutTheAges,WoodAndStone,Workstation" startServer`

This will all become easier as the project and especially the launcher mature further :-)

More or completely alternative line-ups with certain modules / world types selected

Console Commands
--------

Press the `grave` key (usually the \` key immediately above `tab`) to show the in-game console. Mostly everything is case insensitive. Copy paste is supported and up/down arrow will cycle through commands you've used before. Hitting `tab` with a partially typed command will auto-complete it (including abbreviated camel case like lS for listShapes). For partial commands with multiple completion candidates you can `tab` again to cycle through them.

* help - Show in-game help (more thorough)
* search [something] - searches for any command, prefab, or asset with "something" in its name, help text, etc
* flight - just what it sounds like :)
* ghost - no-clip mode (fly through anything)
* hspeed - greatly increase your movement speed
* hjump - jump really high. Almost like flying - but it isn't. Just jump good.
* restoreSpeed - normalizes speed (both horizontal and vertical)
* help giveBlock - Shows detailed help on the "giveBlock" command
* giveBlock Water - Gives 16 water blocks
* giveBlock Stone Stair 99 - Gives you 99 stone stair blocks
* giveBlock Chest - Gives you a Chest block you can place, activate ('E'), put stuff in, break, pick up, place elsewhere, find same stuff in it!
* giveBlock TNT - Gives you 16 TNT blocks you can place and activate ('E') to blow up
* listBlocks - Lists all actively used blocks (have been loaded for the world)
* listFreeShapeBlocks - Lists all blocks that can be requested in any known shape
* listShapes - Lists the available shapes
* healthMax - Fully restores the player's health
* showHealth - Shows the player's health
* teleport 42 42 42 - Warps the player to x = 42, y = 42, z = 42

Building and running from source
--------

Run any commands in the project root directory

* Download / clone the source from GitHub
* To prepare for IntelliJ run: `gradlew idea`
* To prepare for Eclipse run: `gradlew eclipse`
* To run from the command line: `gradlew run`
* Start a headless server: `gradlew start` (stores data in /terasology-server - the Gradle command blocks until server is killed)
* For more tasks: `gradlew tasks`

You may also need to tweak IDE settings further for your convenience, in particular for Eclipse. See [Dev Setup](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Dev-Setup) in our wiki for more details.

Note that by default stored data (config, saves, etc) is sent to a user profile directory like Saved Games under Windows. Add `-homedir` to a run configuration or command line execution to use the project dir instead (this is done automatically in some cases including IntelliJ and `gradlew run`)

If you want to pull down the source code for a module you can easily do so via Gradle:

* `gradlew fetchModuleSample`
* `gradlew idea`

This fetches the module source for the "Sample" module and the second command fetches any dependencies and updates the IntelliJ project structure so you can see it as a module. Likewise for Eclipse or any other setup you should run any one `gradlew` command to make sure the new module's dependencies have been fetched as well. See [Codebase Structure](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Codebase-Structure) in the wiki for more.

Modules
--------

Content, gameplay mechanics, and mostly everything other than the engine that allows the game to run is stored in what we call "modules" which are _similar_ to the traditional meaning of "mods" but intended to be smaller building blocks you'd normally put several of together to make one traditional "mod".

Modules must be enabled during world creation by selecting them using the "Modules" button. Some world generator types may be registered by a module and auto-select that and maybe other modules if you choose that world type. Modules may also enable additional console commands (listed by the "help" command when active).

As opposed to engine level projects listed under https://github.com/MovingBlocks all modules are listed under a different GitHub organization at https://github.com/Terasology

Here's a list of modules bundled with the game by default (as of this writing anyway - this line-up will change now and then). It should roughly match this category in Jenkins: http://jenkins.terasology.org/view/Modules and you can download updated modules from there if needed.
