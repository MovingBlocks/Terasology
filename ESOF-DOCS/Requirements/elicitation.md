# Requirements elicitation

Since that the development process is mentioned by one of the head developers as being *«Nothing formal»*, the requirement maintenance it's achieved through the issue tracker (GitHub), where all the issues as well as necessary improvements are identified. Through the [suggestion forum](http://forum.terasology.org/forum/suggestions.21/) anyone can post an idea, they are also developper foruns where are discussed the suggestions on it's implementation and maintenance.
To the project lead Cervator, *«the ideal setup»* to build up new requisits  would be to perform the following steps:


1. Suggestioning:
    * Someone posts an idea at the suggestion forum mentioned above.
2. Suggestion's avaliation:
    * Users on the forum give feedback and if it's a good idea it will move to the next step.
3. Initial design
    * The OP(Original Poster) or someone starts designing and projecting tecnical questions associated to the implementation.
4. Coding
    * The idea starts getting implemented in code. According to project lead "Cervator" this is usually where the process begins, the steps 1,2,3 are often skipped.
5. Module up
    * Module 
        * If the concept can be integrated into a module it's moved to the [module forum](http://forum.terasology.org/forum/modules.55/).
    * Art
        * If the concept goal is to make assets for the game instead of code itself, it«s moved to the [art forum](http://forum.terasology.org/forum/art-media.25/).
    * Architecture
        * If the goal is to support the game engine or other support library-level functionality, the concept is moved to the [Core Projects forum](http://forum.terasology.org/forum/core-projects.54/).
6. "Release"
    * Soon as the feature is complete-ready it's validated and released. The validation of this feature is explained on the validation section (####linkar para a secção da validação "Modules all live in their own repos on GitHub so authors often push directly without pull requests (PRs). Engine features hit the PR stage, get reviewed, and merged"####).


in relation to the method used:
>As for the why to our process: well, it gives what little structure to the process we can apply without getting in the way of people wanting to do work. (...)  As noted often it gets short-cut when somebody is excited about a feature and shows up with it out of nowhere.
Cervator - Project lead

As quoted above, the process used is the best-fit for this type of project because it allows everyone to give it's contribute and to work at his pace and at the same it's all organized and structured. On the other and it makes planning and estimating hard because the project is dependent of all conributors, which all work at their own way.
The project lead mention at the forum that he aims to get releases out every 2-4 weeks but as it's been said it's dependent on the contributors and on the stability of the modules up to realease.
