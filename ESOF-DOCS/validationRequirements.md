# Validation

*Terasology* is developed by small groups in which one of them forks the project and the group works on that specific fork. Every time a contributor wishes to merge code into the main repository an issue is created derivated from a pull request. These issues are reviewed normally by the user [Cervator](https://github.com/Cervator) and either approved, in which case the code is merged into the main repository, or denied when the code has errors. If it is accepted, the main programmers still look at the code to understand whether it is a valuable adition to the project and only in this case is the code merged ([example issue](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/1760)). When it is denied the errors are reported on the issue back to the author of the pull request and after everything is settled the issue is closed.
