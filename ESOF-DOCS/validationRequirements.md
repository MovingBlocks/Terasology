# Validation

*Terasology* is developed by small groups in which one of them forks the project and the group works on that specific fork. Every time a contributor wishes to merge code into the main repository an issue is created derived from a pull request. These issues are reviewed normally by the user [Cervator](https://github.com/Cervator) (ideally by at least more than one person other than the author) and either approved, in which case the code is merged into the main repository, or denied when the code has errors. The code is tested locally to make sure it works and does what is advertised. If it is accepted, the main programmers still discuss whether it is a valuable adition to the project and only in this case is the code merged ([example issue](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/1760)). When it is denied the errors are reported on the issue back to the author of the pull request and after everything is settled the issue is closed. Often pull requests are specific and inherent to its direct author. When this occurs, the team leader reviews it himself or tries to find someone more familiar with the code to test it.
