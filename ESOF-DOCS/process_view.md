# Process View

The process view diagram includes a set of processes which execute independently and which, all together, form the executable program. This diagram presents a sequential view of the execution of the program isolating the different processes that take part in the game. The sequence demonstrated in the diagram represents the way the game works and how which process comunicates with the others and with the user. For this reason, this diagram is essential to clarify the process of execution of the game.
