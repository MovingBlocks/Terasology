# Process View

The process view includes a set of processes which execute independently and which, all together, form the executable program. This presents a sequential view of the execution of the program isolating the different processes that take part in the game. The sequence demonstrated represents the way the game works and how which process comunicates with the others and with the user. For this reason, this diagram is essential to clarify the process of execution of the game. The following diagram is a sketch of the real sequence diagram which is more complex and includes many other processes. The processes represented are more relevant to clarify the line of execution of the game on a higher level.

The **game engine** represents the main process which initiates the game and calls the **context** and the **menu**. The **context** initializes the visual aspects of the game. It calls the rendering, network, physics processes and many others which are needed for the game to work. Furthermore, it calls the right modules once the game mode is chosen. The **menu** allows two options, either leave the game (and reach the **end** state) or choose the game mode. Following this, the *game mode* executes, receiving the correct modules from the context, and the state of gaming is reached. This state is identified by the **play** process which includes the user playing the game. Finally, the **end** process is called and the application ends.
