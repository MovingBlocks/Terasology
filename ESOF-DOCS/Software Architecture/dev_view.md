## Implementation view

This view is also known as the **development view** and illustrates the software components and their dependencies from a programmer's perspective concerning to the software management. It uses the UML Component diagram to show how the software is decomposed (into software components) for development.

### Component Diagram

Component diagram describes how components are wired together to form larger components and or software systems. 

* A component represents a modular part of a system that encapsulates its contents and whose manifestation is replaceable within its environment.
* Components are wired together by using an assembly connector to connect the required interface of one component with the provided interface of another component. This illustrates the **service consumer - service provider** relationship between the two components.
* To promote intercangeability, components shouldnâ€™t depend directly on other components but rather on interfaces (that are implemented by other components).
