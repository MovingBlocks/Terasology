 * During Record and Replay development, it was noticed that sometimes holding the right or left mouse button caused

 * in the "activateTargetOrOwnedEntity" method of the LocalPlayer and "onAttackRequest" method in the CharacterSystem class.
 * This class is responsible for saving those variables and updating them during a replay.
