/**
 * An instance of this class takes advantage of the content of a number of previously filled buffers
 * to add screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO), outlines, reflections [1], atmospheric haze and volumetric fog [2]
 *
 * As this node does not quite use 3D geometry and only relies on 2D sources and a 2D output buffer, it
 * could be argued that, despite its name, it represents the first step of the PostProcessing portion
 * of the rendering engine. This line of thinking draws a parallel from the film industry where
 * Post-Processing (or Post-Production) is everything that happens -after- the footage for the film
 * has been shot on stage or on location.
 *
 * [1] And refractions? To be verified.
 * [2] Currently not working: the code is there but it is never enabled.
