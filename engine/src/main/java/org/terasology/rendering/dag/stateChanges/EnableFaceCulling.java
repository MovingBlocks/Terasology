/**
 * Enables OpenGL's Face Culling.
 *
 * Face Culling is used to discard triangles facing a particular direction, reducing the total number of triangles
 * to be processed. In normal circumstances the GL_BACK triangles are culled, but in some circumstances, i.e. inside
 * a mesh such as the skysphere, the triangles facing the camera are the GL_BACK ones and the GL_FRONT triangles need
 * to be culled instead. Use SetFacesToCull to set which triangles gets culled - by default GL_BACK.
 *
 * Notice that Terasology by default enables face culling. However, the rendering engine disables it again
 * every frame to be consistent with OpenGL's defaults. This is debatable and might change in the future.
 *
 * See StateChange implementation SetFacesToCull to change from OpenGL's default of culling only the GL_BACK faces.
