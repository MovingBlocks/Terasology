/**
 * An instance of this class renders and blends semi-transparent objects into the content of the existing g-buffer.
 *
 * Notice that this is handled in the process() method by calling the renderAlphaBlend() method of registered
 * instances implementing the RenderSystem interface.
 *
 * Theoretically the same results could be achieved by rendering all meshes in one go, keeping blending
 * always enabled and relying on the alpha channel of the textures associated with a given mesh. In practice
 * blending is an expensive operation and it wouldn't be good performance-wise to keep it always enabled.
 *
 * Also, a number of previous nodes rely on unambiguous meaning for the depth values in the gbuffers,
 * but this node temporarily disable writing to the depth buffer - what value should be written to it,
 * the distance to the semi-transparent surface or what's already stored in the depth buffer? As such
 * semi-transparent objects are handled here, after nodes relying on the depth buffer have done their job.
