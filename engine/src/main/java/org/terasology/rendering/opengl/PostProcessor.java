/**
 * The term "Post Processing" is in analogy to what occurs in the world of Photography:
 * first a number of shots are taken on location or in a studio. The resulting images
 * are then post-processed to achieve specific aesthetic or technical goals.
 *
 * In the context of Terasology, the WorldRenderer takes care of "taking the shots
 * on location" (a world of 3D data such as vertices, uv coordinates and so on)
 * while the PostProcessor starts from the resulting 2D buffers (which in most
 * cases can be thought as images) and through a series of steps it generates the
 * image seen on screen or saved in a screenshot.
 *
 * Most PostProcessor methods represent a single step of the process. I.e the
 * method generateLightShafts() only adds light shafts to the image.
 *
 * Also, most methods follow a typical pattern of operations:
 * 1) enable a material (a shader bundled with its control parameters)
 * 2) bind zero or more 2D buffers to sample from
 * 3) bind and configure an FBO to output to
 * 4) render a quad, usually covering the whole buffer area, but sometimes less
 *
 * Finally, post-processing can be thought as a part of the rendering pipeline,
 * the set of conceptually atomic steps (sometimes called "passes") that eventually
 * leads to the final image. In practice however these steps are not really arranged
 * in a "line" where a given step takes the output of the previous step and provides
 * an input to the next one. Some steps have no dependencies on previous steps and
 * only provide the basis for further processing. Other steps have instead one or
 * more inputs and in turn become the input to one or more further passes.
 *
 * The rendering pipeline the methods of the PostProcessor contribute to is therefore
 * better thought as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in which each step is a node
 * that might or might not have previous nodes in input but will always have at least
 * an output, with the final writing to the default framebuffer (the display) or
 * to a screenshot file.
