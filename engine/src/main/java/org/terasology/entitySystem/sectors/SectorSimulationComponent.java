     * This should only affect the timing of events sent when the chunk is not loaded; a different value should
     * be used when the chunk is loaded. This will allow this value to be set as high as possible (or even to a
     * non-simulating value) if all of the simulation can be postponed until chunk load.
     *
     * This should be set as high as possible, so that fewer simulation events need to be sent in total. The purpose of
     * this value is to allow checking for whether its borders need to be expanded regularly, so that the appropriate
     * events are called if those expanded regions are loaded.
     *
     * E.g. if a city expands while the player is away, it needs to tell the system to load buildings at the edge of
     * the city region without the centre of the city needing to be loaded (to force a simulation).
