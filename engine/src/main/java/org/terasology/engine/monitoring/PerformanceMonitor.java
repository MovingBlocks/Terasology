     * (see example 1) or take advantage of the autocloseable interface implemented by Activity (see example 2).<br>
     * <br>
     *
     * Example 1 - explicitly ending an activity:
     * <pre>
     * PerformanceMonitor.startActivity("myActivity")
     * doSomething();
     * PerformanceMonitor.endActivity()
     * </pre>

     * <pre>
     * try (Activity ignored = PerformanceMonitor.startActivity("myActivity") {
     *     doSomething();
     * }
     * </pre>

     * The latter case is particularly useful whenever the activity's code has a number of possible exit paths,
     * as it might be undesirable or simply non-trivial to add an endActivity() call at the end of each.<br>
