     * Indicates the start of an activity. All started activities must either be ended with a call to endActivity()
     * (see example 1) or take advantage of the autocloseable interface implemented by Activity (see example 2).
     *
     * Example 1 - explicitly ending an activity:
     *
     *      PerformanceMonitor.startActivity("myActivity")
     *      doSomething();
     *      PerformanceMonitor.endActivity()
     *
     * Example 2 - the end of the activity is handled internally:
     *
     *      try (Activity ignored = PerformanceMonitor.startActivity("myActivity") {
     *          doSomething();
     *      }
     *
     * The latter case is particularly useful whenever the activity's code has a number of possible exit paths,
     * as it might be undesirable or simply non-trivial to add an endActivity() call at the end of each.
     *
     * Activities may be nested. Example:
     *
     *      PerformanceMonitor.startActivity("myActivity")
     *      doSomething();
     *
     *          PerformanceMonitor.startActivity("myNestedActivity")
