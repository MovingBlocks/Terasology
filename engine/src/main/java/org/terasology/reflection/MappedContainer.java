 * This annotation is used to mark simple classes that for mapped serialization (this is, they serialize to a map of field name -> value).
 * These classes must not have recursive nested elements (the flatter they are the better), and must not depend on objects appearing multiple times in their structure
 * being the same object - when deserialized each object will be a separate instance.
